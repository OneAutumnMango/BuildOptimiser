# BuildOptimiser

Welcome to the Genshin Build Optimiser

### Getting Started

To get started Download the BOConfigSimplified and BuildOptimiserSimplified files to the same directory.
If you do not have python installed download the .exe version.

To edit the input builds open the .yaml in a text editor and change the values required

### Accounting for EM

In order to account for EM you need to know how often a character vapes/melts. In order to keep track of this and accurately measure it I created [Reaction Ratios](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qSRcUSqEsQPOa_Rr2nty87q4SN8I8N6KIF-iKwdbwUM/edit?usp=sharing).
